	 Going from the Capital to Fengxian County, Singing My Feelings 
(five hundred words)1
	
	 There is a man of Duling in homespun clothes,2
	
	 as I age, my aims grow more inept.
	
	 So foolish in what I swore to become! — 
	 4	 I secretly likened myself to Hou Ji and Xie.3
	
	 At last I proved to be too large to be useful,
	
	 white-haired, and willing to endure hardship.
	
	 When the coffin closes, the issue will be settled,
	 8	 but these aims ever look to fulfillment.
	
	 To the end of my years I worry for the common folk,
	
	 I heave sighs, and my guts burn within.4
	
	 I win mockery from old men, once fellow students,
	 12	 yet I sing out loudly, and with increasing fervor.
	
	 It’s not that I lack aims to live on the rivers and lakes,
	
	 to see days and months pass, aloof and serene.
	
	 But I live in the age of a ruler like Yao and Shun,
	 16	 and cannot bear to just take leave forever.
1  Original note: “Composed at the beginning of the eleventh month in the fourteenth 
year of the Tianbao Reign” 天寶十四載十一月初作. The eleventh month began 
on December 8, 755; on the 16th news arrived that An Lushan had rebelled, though 
the emperor at first did not credit the report.
2  Duling was a region south of the capital, and Du Fu’s family home. “Homespun 
clothes,” literally “plain cloth clothes,” was the mark of a commoner; that is, 
someone with neither class rank nor official position.
3  Hou Ji was the creator of agriculture and Shun’s Minister of agriculture; Xie helped 
Yu in draining the great flood during the reign of Shun. On the face of things 
Du Fu is saying that he wants to become a great minister of state like these two 
ancient figures; however, Hou Ji was also the ancestor of the Zhou ruling house, 
and Xie was the ancestor of the Shang. Given his grief at the death of his son and 
his sense of failure as a parent at the end of the poem, the situation in which the 
poem was written, these associations of glorious futures hoped for and lost cannot 
be entirely suppressed. 
4  Neire 內熱 (“burn within”) is a medical term, but one associated with zeal in 
service.

	 Yet now the halls of State are fully complete,1
	
	 in the building’s structure, no gaps at all.
	
	 Like mallow and pulse, I bend to the sun — 2
	 20	 none can rob a thing of its nature.
	
	 But I turn to consider that ant-breed,
	
	 seeking only their own little holes.
	
	 Why should they aspire to be Great Leviathan3
	 24	 ever aiming to sprawl across the dark sea?
	
	 Hereby I grow aware of life’s pattern.
	
	 and I alone am ashamed to beg for favor.
	
	 I have gone on thus persistently until now — 
	 28	 I could not bear just to sink into the dust.
	
	 In the end Chaofu and Xu You put me to shame,4
	
	 for they could not alter their firm resolve.
	
	 I drink deeply to banish such thoughts for the while,
	 32	 then burst into song, so terribly sad.
	
	 It was year’s end, all the plants were dying,
	
	 the high ridges, rent by the hard winds.
	
	 The royal avenues lay sunk deep in shadow
	 36	 as the traveler set forth at midnight.
	
	 The frost harsh, my coat’s sash snapped,
	
	 my fingers were stiff, I could not tie it.
	
	 At daybreak I passed by Mount Li,
	 40	 the royal couch lay there on its towering height.5
1  The “halls of state,” literally “[palace] porch and ancestral temple,” was a standard 
figure for the structure of government, in which particular cai, “talent”/“timber” 
might be used.
2  That is, he looks toward the emperor.
3  The “Leviathan,” jing 鯨, is probably here simply a figure for greatness, but it is 
hard not to note that this was the standard figure for An Lushan, more “monstrous” 
than great.
4  *Xu You.
5  Xuanzong made winter visits to Mount Li near Chang’an because of the hot springs 
there.

	 Ill-omened auroras stuffed the cold sky,
	
	 they have trampled the slippery valley slopes.
	
	 Vapors surged swelling from Alabaster Pool,1
	 44	 where the royal guardsmen rub and clack.
	
	 There lord and courtiers linger in pleasures,
	
	 music stirs, thundering through empty space.
	
	 All granted baths there have long hat ribbons,2
	 48	 no short homespun tunics join in their feasts.
	
	 Yet the silk bolts apportioned in the royal court
	
	 came first from the homes of poor women.
	
	 Whips flogged their menfolk,
	 52	 gathering taxes to present to the palace.
	
	 His Majesty’s gracious gifts of baskets
	
	 are in fact to preserve the domains.
	
	 If the courtiers disregard perfect government,
	 56	 it is not that our prince throws these things away.
	
	 Many officers are now filling the court,
	
	 it is fitting that kindly men tremble.
	
	 What’s more, I’ve heard golden plate of the Household
	 60	 is now all in the homes of imperial in-laws.3
	
	 In the midst of halls goddesses dance,
	
	 diaphanous mists disperse over marble flesh.
	
	 Cloaks of sable warm the guests,
	 64	 moving notes of flutes follow clear zithers.
1  “Alabaster Pool” was where the Queen Mother of the West feasted King Mu of the 
Zhou, and it was a standard figure for extravagant feasting and pleasures on the part 
of a ruler, generally to the detriment of the polity. In this case the vapors rising are 
literal, since the pleasure palace on Mount Li was built around hot springs.
2  The “long hat ribbons” mark great court officers.
3  Literally “the homes of the Wei’s and the Huo’s,” powerful in-law families of the 
Western Han.

	 Guests are urged to taste camel-hoof stew,
	
	 frosty oranges weigh upon sweet tangerines.
	
	 Crimson gates reek with meat and ale,
	 68	 while on the streets are bones of the frozen dead.
	
	 Splendor and privation, a mere foot apart,
	
	 so upsetting it is hard to recount further.
	
	 My northward cart came where the Jing meets the Wei,
	 72	 at the official crossing I again changed my track.1
	
	 Massed ice floes were coming down from the west,
	
	 looming high as far as the eye could see.
	
	 It seemed as if the Kongtong Mountains had come,2
	 76	 I feared it would strike and break pillars of  Heaven.3
	
	 We were lucky the bridge had not yet collapsed,
	
	 yet the sound of its crossbeams creaked and groaned.
	
	 Travelers held hands to help each other over,
	 80	 if the river grew broader, we could not cross.
	
	 My wife was in a different county,
	
	 ten mouths separated from me by winds and snow.
	
	 Who could go long without checking on them?
	 84	 I hoped to go share their hunger and thirst.
	
	 When I came in the gate, I heard crying out,
	
	 my young son had died of hunger.
	
	 I could not suppress a wail of my own,
	 88	 when even the whole lane was sobbing.
1  The situation here is far from clear. A “crossing” was a ferry point; later we see Du 
Fu on one of the bridges, clearly crossing on foot. We know that some of the Wei 
River bridges could accommodate vehicles but this does not seem like one of them. 
It is possible that he “changes his track” because no boats are crossing under flood 
conditions.
2  Kongtong was a fabled mountain range in the Western Regions.
3  This alludes to the famous story of the rebel Gonggong battling with the mythic 
emperor Zhuanxu and breaking one of the pillars that supported Heaven.

Song for the Painted Landscape Screen of  Liu Dan, Sheriff of Fengxian

	 What shamed me was my role as a father,
	
	 lack of food had caused this infant’s death.
	
	 I could not have known that before the harvest
	 92	 such calamity would befall our poverty.
	
	 All my life I have been exempt from taxes,
	
	 and my name is not registered for conscription.
	
	 Considering what bitter things still happened to me,
	 96	 ordinary people must truly be desperate.
	
	 I brood silently on those who lost livelihoods,
	
	 then think of our troops in far garrisons.
	
	 Reasons for worry are as great as South Mountain,
	100	 a chaotic swirl that cannot be grasped.
	
	 In the tenth lunar month of 755 Du Fu took a low appointment as an 
administrator in one of the imperial guard units. In the eleventh month 
he went to see his family, whom he had moved to Fengxian County. At the 
time An Lushan had already risen in rebellion, but the news had not yet 
reached the capital. We do not know how much this poem came purely from 
its moment or was revised in hindsight, but the sense of crisis — before the 
real crisis was known — is clear.

	 Song for the Painted Landscape Screen of  Liu Dan, Sheriff of Fengxian1
	
	 Maple trees should not be growing in a hall — 
	
	 amazing! — how these rivers and hills give off fog and mist.
	
	 I’ve heard you wiped away all other pictures of the heartland,
	 4	 as on a whim you have painted the zest of gray isles.
	
	 Painters are innumerable,
	
	 but a skilled hand can’t be found;
	
	 Facing this, heart and spirit fuse with it,
	 8	 and I know how you honor the brush-hair and silk.
